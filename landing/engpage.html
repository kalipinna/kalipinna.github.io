      you look for, in this case a dress. <br> Point is: more than 80 product for each design, folders to find collections more easily, and more!

    <div id="teespringsection"> right now on teespring, besides the pillows which are necessary to show color options, a few designs already have lots of other products enabled. The only downside of this website is that the server is slow with the upload, which means it will take
      some time for me to copy everything there, and that most items will only work with transparent designs: if there is anything you'd like to buy from there that you've seen on redbubble don't hesitate letting me know! It offers so many interesting
      products, like yoga mats, beach towels, water bottles...
    </div>
    <img src="teespring.gif" data-aos="flip-down" alt="samples of my teespring store">
    <div id="threadlesssection"> I'm already adding designs to my threadless shop, they have special products like weekend bags that can be fully personalized (I like to play with gradients in their backgrounds) + like I said threadless lets me donate part of my earnings to charity,
      it offers different options and I'm picking them randomly (and not based on what's featured on the design), but I want to hit them all! Again, if there is a specific design you'd like to get from here and not redbubble, ask and I'll give it priority!
